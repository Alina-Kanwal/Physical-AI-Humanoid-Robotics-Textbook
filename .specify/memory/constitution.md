# Physical AI & Humanoid Robotics Constitution

## Core Principles

### Technical Accuracy and Correctness
All content must be technically accurate and factually correct. Claims about robotics, AI, and physical systems must be verified through reliable sources before inclusion. No unverified technical claims allowed.

### Clear and Simple Explanations
Content must use simple, concise language that is accessible to beginner to intermediate developers. Complex concepts should be broken down into digestible parts with step-by-step explanations.

### Practical, Example-Driven Learning
Every concept should be accompanied by practical examples, code snippets, or diagrams where relevant. Theory must be grounded in practice to enable hands-on learning.

### Consistent Structure Across Chapters
All chapters must follow the established structure: Introduction, Key Concepts, Examples (code/diagrams), and Summary. This ensures predictable navigation and learning experience.

### AI-Assisted but Human-Readable Writing
While using AI assistance for content generation and refinement, all content must remain clearly readable and understandable by humans. AI-generated content must be reviewed and edited for clarity.

### Source Verification and Originality
All technical claims must be verified using reliable sources (official documentation, research labs, reputable technical blogs). No copied content allowed; all text must be original.

## Book Structure Requirements
Content must be written in Markdown (.md/.mdx) format, organized using Docusaurus book layout conventions. Each chapter must focus on one clear topic and build upon previous chapters. Chapters should be focused and readable, avoiding overly long sections.

## Development Workflow
Use Spec-Kit Plus for spec-driven writing approach. Use Claude Code for generating and refining content. Follow Docusaurus conventions for sidebar and navigation. Ensure compatibility with GitHub Pages deployment. Maintain consistent formatting across all files.

## Governance

All content must comply with these constitutional principles. Changes to this constitution require explicit approval and documentation of the rationale. All chapters and content must be verified for compliance with these principles before merging. Content must be suitable for self-learning and reference purposes.
