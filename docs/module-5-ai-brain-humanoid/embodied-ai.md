# Embodied AI & Situated Cognition

## Introduction

Embodied AI represents a fundamental departure from traditional AI by emphasizing the role of physical embodiment in intelligence. Situated cognition theory suggests that intelligence emerges from the dynamic interaction between an agent and its environment. This chapter explores how these principles apply to humanoid robotics and the design of intelligent embodied systems.

## The Embodiment Hypothesis

### Core Principles
- **Embodiment**: Intelligence is shaped by the physical form and its interactions
- **Emergence**: Complex behaviors arise from simple embodied interactions
- **Situatedness**: Intelligence is context-dependent and environmentally grounded
- **Enaction**: Knowledge emerges through active engagement with the world

### Contrast with Traditional AI
- **Symbolic vs. Subsymbolic**: Grounded vs. abstract representations
- **Offline vs. Online**: Pre-programmed vs. real-time learning
- **Isolated vs. Interactive**: Standalone vs. environment-coupled systems
- **Static vs. Dynamic**: Fixed vs. adaptive behaviors

### Evidence from Biology
- **Morphological computation**: Physical properties contributing to computation
- **Evolutionary constraints**: Body plan influencing cognitive development
