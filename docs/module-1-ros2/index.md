# Module 1: ROS 2 - Robotic Nervous System

## Overview

ROS 2 (Robot Operating System 2) serves as the foundational framework for robot communication, control, and coordination. In this module, you'll learn how ROS 2 acts as the "nervous system" of robotic applications, enabling different components to communicate and work together seamlessly.

## Learning Objectives

By the end of this module, you will be able to:
- Understand the core concepts of ROS 2 architecture
- Create and manage nodes, topics, and services
- Model robots using URDF (Unified Robot Description Format)
- Implement basic ROS 2 programs in Python

## Module Structure

This module is organized into the following chapters:

1. [Introduction to ROS 2](./introduction-to-ros2.md) - Core concepts and architecture
2. [Nodes, Topics, and Services](./nodes-topics-services.md) - Communication patterns
3. [URDF and Robot Modeling](./urdf-modeling.md) - Robot description and modeling
4. [ROS 2 Python Examples](./rclpy-examples.md) - Practical implementation examples

## Prerequisites

Before starting this module, ensure you have:
- Basic Python programming knowledge
- Understanding of Linux command line
- Completed the Introduction chapter
